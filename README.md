# POWER_Bi_Project
I made this project using power bi. It is a sales dashboard where I compare increases in sales with different parameters and also made a sales forecast for further 15 days. 
     Here I import data, clean and process data, design dashboards, use advanced charts and maps, filters, and slicers, forecast in power bi, export dashboards as pdf, project insights, and learnings. This is an end-to-end project in Power BI.
